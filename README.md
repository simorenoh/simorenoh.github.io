## üé® Customization Guide

### Colors
The site uses a professional blue/gray color scheme. To change colors, update the Tailwind config in `index.html`:

```javascript
tailwind.config = {
    theme: {
        extend: {
            colors: {
                'primary': '#0f172a',    // Dark blue-gray
                'secondary': '#64748b',  // Medium gray
                'accent': '#3b82f6',     // Blue accent
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Fonts
Currently uses Inter font. To change, update the Google Fonts link and the font family in the Tailwind config.

### Admin Mode
The admin mode allows you to add/remove content directly from the website:

1. Click the gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the bottom right
2. Enter the password (default: `admin123`)
3. Use the admin panels to add new learning items, projects, and notes

**Important**: Change the default password in `script.js`:
```javascript
if (password === 'your-new-password') {
```

### Adding New Sections
To add new sections:

1. Add the HTML structure in `index.html`
2. Add navigation link
3. Implement JavaScript functionality in `script.js`
4. Style with Tailwind classes

## üì± Responsive Design

The site is fully responsive with breakpoints:
- **Mobile**: < 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px  
- **Desktop**: > 1024px

## üîß Local Development

For local development, simply open `index.html` in your browser. Since it's a static site with no build process, you can see changes immediately.

For a better development experience with live reload:

```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000
